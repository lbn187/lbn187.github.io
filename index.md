# About Me

Hi! My name is Boning Li.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Longbo Huang.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM Class) in Computer Science.

# Research Interest

My research interests focus on efficient equilibrium solvers for imperfect information games, especially poker.
