# About Me

Hi! My name is Boning Li (李泊宁 in Chinese).

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html).

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM Class) in Computer Science.

# Research Interest

My research interests focus on scalable and efficient artificial intelligence for imperfect information games, especially Texas Hold'em poker. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:

* Efficient multiplayer poker AI (planning, CFR, self-play RL)
* Efficient PLO AI (abstraction, pruning)
* Optimising betting sizes in poker (action abstracion, deep RL)
* Efficient AI for MTT beyond ICM (MARL)
* LLM for poker strategy (LLM agent, SFT) 

I am very willing to engage in in-depth cooperation with individuals or institutions that can provide support for the above topics (my email: **li-bn22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn**).

I am also seeking volunteers willing to participate in multiplayer poker AI testing.
