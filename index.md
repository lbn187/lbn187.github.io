# About Me

Hi! My name is Boning Li.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Longbo Huang.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM Class) in Computer Science.

# Research Interest

My research interests focus on efficient artificial intelligence for imperfect information games, especially Texas Hold'em poker.

# Recruitment for Interns

I am happy to host remote/onsite graduate/undergraduate intern. I have **competitive Texas Hold'em Equilibrium Solver** as well as many interesting research topics.

If you are interested in game theory, deep reinforcement learning or poker, please contact me (email: **li-bn22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn**)!
